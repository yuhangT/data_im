Some "circuit breakers" installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures	The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor once again couldn't handle the selling pressure	3
Some "circuit breakers" installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures.	Heavy selling of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures in Chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward	3
The finger-pointing has already begun	The equity market was illiquid.	3
The equity market was illiquid	Once again {the specialists} were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange	2

Then in a lightning plunge, the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year, chalking up a 190.58-point, or 6.9%, loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume	Final-hour trading accelerated to 108.1 million shares, a record for the Big Board	3
Final-hour trading accelerated to 108.1 million shares, a record for the Big Board	At the end of the day, 251.2 million shares were traded	3

In percentage terms, however, the Dow's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83, or 8%, a week after Black Monday	The Dow fell 22.6% on Black Monday	1
Shares of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, were extremely active all day Friday, reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group	Wall Street's takeover-stock speculators, or "risk arbitragers," had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and UAL stock would rise	4
At 2:43 p.m. EDT, came the sickening news: The Big Board was halting trading in UAL, "pending news	On the exchange floor, "as soon as UAL stopped trading, we braced for a panic	2
On the exchange floor, "as soon as UAL stopped trading, we braced for a panic	Several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed	3

The market crumbled	Arbitragers couldn't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every "rumor" stock they had	2
But as panic spread, speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses	When trading was halted in Philip Morris, the stock was trading at 41, down 3 3/8, while IBM closed 5 5/8 lower at 102	2
Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic "stop-loss" orders, which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels	Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals, including computer-guided program traders	3
Now, at 3:07, one of the market's post-crash "reforms" took hold as the S&P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points, equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials	Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, trading was temporarily halted in Chicago	3
As a result, the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart	Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board	4
Without the guidepost of stock-index futures many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board	The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders	3
The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders	It screwed things up," said one major specialist	3
When the airline information came through, it cracked every model we had for the marketplace	We didn't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do	2
But stocks kept falling	The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt	3

the circuit breaker "worked well mechanically	it's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things	3
At about 3:30 p.m. EDT, S&P futures resumed trading, and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line	Buyers stepped in to the futures pit	2
At about 3:45, the S&P market careened to still another limit, of 30 points down, and trading was locked again	the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points	3
I have a hunch that this particular decline today is something `more ado about less	It would be my inclination to advise clients not to sell, to look for an opportunity to buy	2
At Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's biggest brokerage firm, a news release was prepared headlined "Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop	The release cautioned that "there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987" and that there are still "attractive investment opportunities" in the stock market	3
And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading	It's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront	2
As the Dow average ground to its final 190.58 loss Friday, the S&P pit stayed locked at its 30-point trading limit	2,000 S&P contracts were for sale on the close, the equivalent of $330 million in stock	3
it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning	Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself	2
Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself	At those levels, stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers, who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall, and simultaneously sell off stocks	1
But the exchange will "look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks	Obviously we'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer-community obligations weren't met	3
But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash, the "upstairs" firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday's blood-letting	Mr. Phelan said, "It will take another day or two" to analyze who was buying and selling Friday	1

L.J. Hooker, based in Atlanta, is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code	Its parent company, Hooker Corp. of Sydney, Australia, is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator	4
The $409 million bid is estimated by Mr. Simpson as representing 75% of the value of all Hooker real-estate holdings in the U.S	Not included in the bid are Bonwit Teller or B. Altman & Co., L.J. Hooker's department-store chains	1
L.J. Hooker was a small home-building company based in Atlanta in 1979 when Mr. Simpson was hired to push it into commercial development	The company grew modestly until 1986, when a majority position in Hooker Corp. was acquired by Australian developer George Herscu, currently Hooker's chairman	4
In addition, Robert Sakowitz, chief executive of the Sakowitz chain, is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company	The Merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by First Boston Corp	3

The test may come today	Friday's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act	2
Friday's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act	Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday's close would take place at today's closing prices	3
Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday's close would take place at today's closing prices	Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle didn't begin to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday	1
they're ready	Many have raised cash levels, which act as a buffer against steep market declines	3
Mario Gabelli, for instance, holds cash positions well above 20% in several of his funds	Windsor Fund's John Neff and Mutual Series' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20% and 30%, respectively, this year	3
A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday	Stock-fund sales have rebounded in recent months, but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels	3
Many fund managers argue that now's the time to buy	Vincent Bajakian, manager of the $1.8 billion Wellington Fund, added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb, Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday	3

Still, fund groups aren't taking any chances	They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund investors in October 1987	2
Fidelity on Saturday opened its 54 walk-in investor centers across the country	The centers normally are closed through the weekend	1
In an unusual move, several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll-free phone lines	We view {Friday's} market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors," a recording at Gabelli & Co. funds said over the weekend	3

Half of them are really scared and want to sell but I'm trying to talk them out of it	If they all were bullish, I'd really be upset	1
The backdrop to Friday's slide was markedly different from that of the October 1987 crash	Two years ago, unlike today, the dollar was weak, interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued	2
From the investors' standpoint, institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson . . . by selling at the lows" on Black Monday	This time, "I don't think we'll get a panic reaction	2
Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday wouldn't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights, including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas	Now, those routes aren't expected to begin until Jan	2
that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout	their customers would like it very much	2
America West, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be	that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all	1
Indeed, a random check Friday didn't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations	Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time	3
and expects to have the plane on time	It's so close to completion, Boeing's told us there won't be a problem	3
A spokesman for AMR Corp. said Boeing has assured American Airlines it will deliver a 757 on time later this month	American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year and isn't anticipating any changes in that timetable	3
No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table	We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back	2
The investment community, for one, has been anticipating a speedy resolution	Though Boeing's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday, it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders	2
Though Boeing's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday, it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders	The market has taken two views: that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term	3
The market has taken two views: that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term	Boeing's shares fell $4 Friday to close at $57.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange	1

But we wouldn't go into them alone," and Canadian Utilities' equity stake would be small	Ideally, we'd like to be the operator {of the project} and a modest equity investor	3
Britain's government plans to raise about #20 billion ($31.05 billion) from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities	The planned electric utility sale, scheduled for next year, is alone expected to raise #13 billion	3
and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it	This is a real thrust on our utility side	3
Canadian Utilities isn't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain, in anticipation of the privatization program	We're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England," said Bruce Stram, vice president, corporate strategy and corporate planning, with Enron Corp., Houston, a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator	3

By setting up the joint venture, Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land, while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet	The company is putting up only 10% of the capital, although it is responsible for providing management, planning and processing services to the joint venture	3
The timing of Quantum's chief executive officer, John Hoyt Stookey, appeared to be nothing less than inspired, because he had just increased Quantum's reliance on plastics	The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years	2
But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum's profit is plummeting	Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter	2
To a degree, Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life	Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history, these producers now see their prices eroding	3
And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them	We were all wonderful heroes last year Now we're at the bottom of the heap	3
We were all wonderful heroes last year	Now we're at the bottom of the heap	1
At Quantum the trouble is magnified by the company's heavy dependence on plastics	the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive's job in 1986	2
In recent months the price of polyethylene, even more than that of other commodity plastics, has taken a dive	Benchmark grades, which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring, have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents	3
By many accounts, an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year	China, which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene, abruptly halted them	3
to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up	People were even hoarding bags	3
One doubter is George Krug, a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks	Noting others' estimates of when price increases can be sustained, he remarks, "Some say October.	3
Some say October	Some say November	1
Some say November	I say 1992	1
I say 1992	that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers' plans to expand production capacity	2
A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy	The company is trying to carry out a three-year, $1.3 billion plant-expansion program started this year	3
Quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders, because its stock price wasn't reflecting the huge profit increases	Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation	1
On top of everything else, Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris, Ill	After an explosion idled the plant in June, the company progressed in September to within 12 hours of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it.	3
Then a second explosion occurred	Two workers died and six remain in the hospital	2
This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum's fortunes	Until this year, the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards	2
A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum's financial future	When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand, calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward.	2
Not everything looks grim for Quantum	The plant expansion should strengthen the company's sway in the polyethylene business, where market share is often taken through sheer capacity	2
The plant expansion should strengthen the company's sway in the polyethylene business, where market share is often taken through sheer capacity	By lifting ethylene production, the expansion will also lower the company's raw material costs	3
Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals, propane marketing	Through a venture with its investment banker, First Boston Corp., Quantum completed in August an acquisition of Petrolane Inc. in a transaction valued at $1.18 billion	3
Petrolane is the second-largest propane distributor in the U.S	The largest, Suburban Propane, was already owned by Quantum	3
Still, Quantum has a crisis to get past right now	the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor	2
the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor	The name surfacing in rumors is British Petroleum Co	3
that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit, and dismissing its 14 employees, in a move to save money	RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms, FCB/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson	3

RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because "there was supposed to be a future	the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks, wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies	3
the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks' upcoming season	The studies {on closing the unit} couldn't be completed until now	1
Brazil is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas, which expired Sept. 30	Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that haven't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1, 1990	3
In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation	Of the remaining 20% needed, the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15% to foreign suppliers	3
which isn't included in the quota program	Other countries that don't have formal steel quotas with the U.S., such as Taiwan, Sweden and Argentina, also have supplied steel	3
It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade, which has been notoriously managed, subsidized and protected by governments	The U.S. termed its plan, a "trade liberalization program," despite the fact that it is merely an extension	3
Mexico virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas	South Korea is set to get a small increase to about 1.95%	1
Mexico virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas	South Korea is set to get a small increase to about 1.95%	3
South Korea is set to get a small increase to about 1.95%	That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included	3
The EC and Japan -- the U.S.'s largest steel suppliers -- haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent	The EC steel industry has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%	3
The EC steel industry has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%	Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9%	3
Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program	The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela	3
The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks	That was essentially made up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from cutting Japan's allowance	3
Elcotel, a telecommunications company, had net income of $272,000, or five cents a share, in its year-earlier second quarter, ended Sept. 30	Revenue totaled $5 million	3
Elcotel, a telecommunications company, had net income of $272,000, or five cents a share, in its year-earlier second quarter, ended Sept. 30.	that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $4 million	1
The lower results reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones, Elcotel's primary business	Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas	2
Foremost among those is the company's entrance into the public facsimile business	Within the next year, Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines in hotels, municipal buildings, drugstores and other public settings around the country	3
Within the next year, Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines, made by Minolta in Japan, in hotels, municipal buildings, drugstores and other public settings around the country	Elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect, store and forward billing data	3
Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls	Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone not just phones produced by Elcotel	3
The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent, called Attack, which quickly won a 30% stake in the Japanese markets	They don't want to get caught again	2
that shipments to Phoenix started late last month	the company will study results from this market before expanding to others	4
Superconcentrates aren't entirely new for P&G	The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack	2
after watching the success of Attack	When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%	3
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%	With the help of Lemon Cheer, P&G's share is now estimated to be 12%	1
With superconcentrates, however, it isn't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more	many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine	2
it will take up less shelf space	When shelf space was cheap, bigger was better	1
But with so many brands vying for space, that's no longer the case	If the new Cheer sells well, the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates	2
Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S	To be sure, Kao wouldn't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G, which has about 23% of the market	1
Some believe P&G's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese	This is something P&G would do with or without Kao," says Mr. Zurkuhlen	3
With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening, many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills	They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S	2
Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view	Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher	2
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade	He said such results should be "measurable in dollars and cents" in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan	3
that the objective "is not to get definitive action by spring or summer, it is rather to have a blueprint for action	that she expected "perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we're moving in earnest	1
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills	Many called it simply a contrast in styles	3
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic	Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand	1
I think my line has been very consistent	I am painted sometimes as ferocious, perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement	1
I am painted sometimes as ferocious, perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement	I don't feel very ferocious	1
I don't feel very ferocious	I don't feel either hard or soft	3
I don't feel either hard or soft	I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade	3
Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill	She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified	3
But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition	She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and shouldn't be tackled by setting quantitative targets	3
At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief	My impression was that you would be a scary old lady," he said	3
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years	Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991, but the Japanese have denied making any such promise	3
I am against managed trade	I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market	2
The company didn't break out its fourth-quarter results	In the latest nine months net income was $4.7 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenue of $44.3 million	1
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability	The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak	3
Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene	It has plunged 13% since July to around 26 cents a pound	3
It has plunged 13% since July to around 26 cents a pound	A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents	1
Beginning in mid-1987, prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand	Companies added capacity furiously	2
Companies added capacity furiously	Now, greatly increased supplies are on the market, while the dollar is stronger, and domestic economic growth is slower	1
Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker	Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year	3
Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that didn't materialize	The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period	2
many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter, though still not to the level of 1988's fourth quarter	During the 1988 second half, many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits	3
Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies' earnings this year	Prices have stayed well above most companies' expectations	2
Prices have stayed well above most companies' expectations	Demand has been much stronger than anticipated	2
Demand has been much stronger than anticipated, and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter	We could see higher oil prices this year	2
While oil prices have been better than expected, natural gas prices have been worse	In the third quarter, they averaged about 5% less than they were in 1988	3

the disclosure couldn't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community	It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting	3
The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies, reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies	Last summer, Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods.	3
However, these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization	There's no evidence that the Soviet program to (illegally) acquire Western technology has diminished	2
The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26%.	At this price, the shares would have to rise above HK$6.05 for subscribers to Salomon's issue to profitably convert their warrants	2

the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments	that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels	3
The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels	It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels, compared with this year's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988	2
But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted won't be felt until the second half of next year	Until then, limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $4-a-bushel level	2
Until then, limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $4-a-bushel level	On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday, wheat for December delivery settled at $4.0675 a bushel, unchanged	3

Late Thursday, after the close of trading, the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop	It was near the low range of estimates, at 130 million 90-pound boxes, compared with 146.6 million boxes last season	3
However, as expected, Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $1.34 a pound from around $1.55	Friday's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time	2
Friday's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time	It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $1.3210 a pound	3
Brazilian juice is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities	Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product, which is going to be in plentiful supply	2
The price cut appeared to be aimed even more at Europe, where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen	It's a dollar-priced product, and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe	2
New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $2 a pound at midyear	Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas, downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January, when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak	3

This market still wants to go higher," said Nauman Barakat, a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc	He predicted that the November contract will reach $21.50 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange	3
There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets	Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes	1
There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and can't produce as much as it could sell	Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies, particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria	2
And Carl Spielvogel, chief executive officer of Saatchi's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit, said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company, but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi	Mr. Spielvogel said he wouldn't launch a hostile bid	3
But {otherwise} it would undoubtedly come back" with an offer by management	any buy-out would be led by the current board, whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi	3
The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back	That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1	1
That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1	Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has a reputation as a savvy financial manager, and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi's poor financial state	2

seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry	In New York, the Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code	3
Until recently, industry analysts believed decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in this year's third and fourth quarters	All bets are off, analysts say, because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains	1
Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage, but the retailers' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run	Retailers are just in disarray	3

GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade	The company, currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992	2
The company, currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992	Just a month ago, GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987	2
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year	GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin	2
The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs	Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich issued a statement Friday blasting GM's "flagrant insensitivity" toward union members	2

Yokich, who recently became head of the union's GM department, issued a statement Friday blasting GM's "flagrant insensitivity" toward union members	The auto maker's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed "disarray" and an "inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information," Mr. Yokich said	3
The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio	Robert White, Canadian Auto Workers union president, used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney	2
Workers at plants in Van Nuys, Calif., Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Mich., were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars	GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese, Quebec, company and union officials said	3

Assuming that the market doesn't head into a bottomless free fall, some executives think Friday's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating	This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations, rather than to any fundamentals," said John Young, chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co., whose shares dropped $3.125 to $48.125	3
A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council were only too happy to personalize their criticism	People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs, do something about takeovers, do something about Donald Trump," said Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT Corp., whose stock dropped $3.375	3

Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it	Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad	1
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren	In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court	2

But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role, strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech	Each time the court revisits an issue, the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result," he said	3
Moreover, in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s, he knew that the tables might turn in the future	He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt	3
but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court's cutbacks in civil rights	We could sweep it under the rug and hide it, but I'm not going to do it," he said in a speech last month	3
a point that hasn't escaped legal scholars	Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a "generation-skipping" flavor to current dissents	3
Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a "generation-skipping" flavor to current dissents	The dissenters in the Warren Court, he says, appeared to be writing for the short-term, suggesting that the court's direction might change soon. "Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future," he says	3
The dissenters in the Warren Court appeared to be writing for the short-term	Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future	1
Justice Blackmun also seems feisty about his new role	Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues	3
But his level of frustration showed in a recent, impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago	He concluded his remarks by quoting, emotionally and at some length, according to those present, the late Martin Luther King's famous "I Have a Dream" speech from the 1963 March on Washington	3
it also differs in an important way from recent history	The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created	3
Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C	A Canadian bank bought another thrift, in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank	3
Under these deals, the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets	These "clean-bank" transactions leave the bulk of bad assets, mostly real estate, with the government, to be sold later	3
but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency	These thrifts are beached whales	3
NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets	NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association, Houston	3
NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association, Houston, which had assets of $2.8 billion	NCNB Texas National Bank will pay the RTC a premium of $129 million for $3.5 billion in deposits	3

Time will "dramatically de-emphasize" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives	cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000, to four million	3
Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way to draw advertisers	In recent years, Reader's Digest, New York Times Co. 's McCall's, and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation	3
Besides, Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky	Giveaways just give people the wrong image," said Mr. Heinemann	3
Giveaways just give people the wrong image	That perception takes the focus off the magazine	2
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers	What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it," said Mr. Heinemann	3
What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it	We are trying to create quality and involvement	3
Still, Time's move is being received well, once again	It's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more," said Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency	3

A few drops in circulation are of no consequence	It's not a show of weakness	2
It's not a show of weakness	they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits	3
the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry: a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away	The question is how much are we getting from each reader	3
When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago, Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing	They said, `follow CNN	1

It is bigger, faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks	Its niche as the "network of record" during major crises draws elite audiences around the world	3
But for all its success, CNN has hit a plateau	Although viewership soars when big news breaks, it ebbs during periods of calm	3
Although viewership soars when big news breaks, it ebbs during periods of calm	CNN executives worry that the network's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale	2
Just the fact we're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin	You can't live on that	3
So CNN, a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc., is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel	Tonight, to kick off the effort, CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years, an hourlong show at 6 p.m. Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts	2
The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty	To distinguish itself, CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program	3
To distinguish itself, CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program	It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers	3
But that won't be easy	Networks, like other consumer products, develop images in peoples' minds that aren't easy to change	2
The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive	Already, CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel	3
CNN wants to change its viewers' habits	Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel-zapping "grazers" and news junkies, who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN, according to audience research	2
Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel-zapping "grazers" and news junkies, who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN, according to audience research	That's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks	1
That's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks	The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data, and advertising, become more important to cable-TV channels	3
Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service	It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world, so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks	2
It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world, so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks	It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called "Daybreak," "Daywatch," "Newsday," and "Newsnight," but the shows varied little in content, personality or look	3
Now, the push is on for more-distinctive shows	Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity	3
Some in the industry are skeptical	I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what, at least in the public's mind, is the same news," says Reuven Frank, the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report	3
The evening news is also slated as CNN's stage for its big push into investigative journalism	In August, the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill, the former head of news specials at ABC	2
She's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly, in-depth segments, with an eye toward breaking big stories	the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its "branded" programs, in the way "60 Minutes" did so well for CBS	2
that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment, especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces	They've never shown any inclination to spend money on production," says Michael Mosettig, a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour	3
The network's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards, resulting in a less-experienced work force	CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15%, but they're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks	3
CNN is my wire service	they're on top of everything	2
In any case, cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN's format	They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage	2
They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage	We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest, long-format programming	2
The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound	In the Pennzoil/Texaco litigation, the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound	3

analysts said it did play a role in the market's decline	Analysts immediately viewed the price data, the grimmest inflation news in months, as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall	3
But Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis, blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump	I would say this is not bad news	2
I would say this is not bad news	this is a blip	3
this is a blip	The core rate is not really out of line	2
Overall, the index has climbed at a 5.1% compound annual rate since the start of the year	While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year, that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0% increase for all of 1988	1
Moreover, this year's good inflation news may have ended last month, when energy prices zoomed up 6.5% after plunging 7.3% in August	Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead, leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain	1
but the 0.9% climb was higher than most anticipated	the resurgence {in inflation} is going to continue for a few months	2
the resurgence {in inflation} is going to continue for a few months	that inflation will moderate next year	3
that last month's rise "isn't as bad an omen" as the 0.9% figure suggests	If you examine the data carefully, the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices, rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods	2
Passenger car prices jumped 3.8% in September, after climbing 0.5% in August and declining in the late spring and summer	the September increase was a one-time event, coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models	1
Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event, coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models	Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations, car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase	1

David L. Paul, chairman and chief executive officer, criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which issued the directive, saying it was "inappropriate" and based on "insufficient" reasons	He said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision	3
In March, regulators labeled CenTrust a "troubled institution," largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses	In the same month, the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track	3
CenTrust holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation	Since April, it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $890 million from $1.35 billion	1
Since April, it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $890 million from $1.35 billion	only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission	3
only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission	The remainder are commercial loan participations, or private placements, that aren't filed with the SEC and don't have a ready market	1
CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds	The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings, but CenTrust has said it can't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market	3
Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust's and other thrifts' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market	The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new, somber regulatory climate	2
The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits, according to Mr. Paul	Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction long before now	3
Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction long before now	Many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal	2
CenTrust, however, touts the branch sale, saying it would bring in $150 million and reduce the thrift's assets to $6.7 billion from $9 billion	It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $82 million, or about 1.2% of assets, from a negative $33 million as of Sept. 30, thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards	3
The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers, who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60% of Europe's TV shows be produced in Europe	So far, the French have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail	1

The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular, with American programs second	Given a choice, everybody will watch a home-produced show	3
Thus, Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own, programs with broader appeal	We've basically got to start from scratch, to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see	1
Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising	Since production costs were guaranteed, it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication	2
Now, however, commercial channels are coming to most European countries, and at the same time, satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly	Just last week, Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time	3

The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss's other ventures	In a Madrid hotel room recently, a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, only to be urged by the British announcer to "stay tuned for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo	3
After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance	The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end	2
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies, and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting	In recent months, a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture	3
Already, British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system	Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit	3
But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid	GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts	2
Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators	Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts, and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry	2
it isn't interested in Ferranti	We have nothing to say about this affair, which doesn't concern us," a Matra official said Sunday	3
The missile venture is a needed response to the "new environment" in defense contracting	For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries	2
The venture's importance for Thomson is great	the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans	2

that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate	Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989's first half, about 1% below the 1988 level	1
The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping," and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas	volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s	3
the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly	The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is "down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration	2
Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports	That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico	2

Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc., a computer retailer	In July, the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $7.4 million, or 23 cents a share. 	3
This month, however, Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 hadn't met expectations	it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share, down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period	3

In computer publishing, a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc., which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays	Until recently, Adobe had a lock on the market for image software, but last month Apple, Adobe's biggest customer, and Microsoft rebelled	3
The short-term outlook for Adobe's business, however, appears strong	The company is beginning to ship a new software program that's being heralded as a boon for owners of low-end printers sold by Apple	2
Meanwhile, competition between various operating systems spells trouble for software firms generally	It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales	2
The gap between winners and laggards will grow	In personal computers, Apple, Compaq and IBM are expected to tighten their hold on their business.	3

IOWA IS MAKING a comeback.	The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s	3
Between 1987 and 1988, North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people	Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin	1
The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race	Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980	3
At the same time, several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround	Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population	3
This doesn't mean they're less likely to live alone, however	That share has remained at about 24% since 1970	1
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children	In 1988, 10% of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from 15% in 1970	3
Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives	Only 17% of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988, down from 26% in 1970	3

Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families	Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group	3
Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich	Average household income for the sample was $194,000, and average net assets were reported as $775,000	3
The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class	Although they represent only 2% of the population, they control nearly one-third of discretionary income	2
Despite their considerable incomes and assets, 40% of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one-fourth don't feel that they have made it	Twenty percent don't even feel they are financially well off	3

Per-capita personal income in the U.S. grew faster than inflation last year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis	The amount of income divvied up for each man, woman and child was $16,489 in 1988, up 6.6% from $15,472 in 1987	2
There are 13.1 million students in college this fall, up 2% from 1988	About 54% are women, and 44% are part-time students	3

The council's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years	Obviously they're not in touch with what's going on	2
Obviously they're not in touch with what's going on	Pool is hot in New York and Chicago where "upscale, suit-and-tie places" are adding tables	3
Pool is hot in New York and Chicago where "upscale, suit-and-tie places" are adding tables	With today's tougher drunk driving laws people don't want to just sit around and drink	2
where rooms average $200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $3.50 a pop	At the lounge, manager Elizabeth Dyer won't admit patrons in jeans, T-shirts or tennis shoes	3
But a majority of the Addison council didn't buy those arguments	Introducing pool, argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker, would be "dangerous	3
Introducing pool would be "dangerous	It would open a can of worms	2
Addison is no stranger to cans of worms, either	After its previous mayor committed suicide last year, an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects, gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town's coffers for trips and retreats	2
The revelations embarrassed town officials, although they argued that the problems weren't as severe as the media suggested	Now comes the pool flap	1
I think there's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous	I thought this was all taken care of in `The Music Man	3
For instance: "Haole" (white) is not the ultimate insult	Mainland haole" is	3

Of all the ethnic tensions in America, which is the most troublesome right now	A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City	3
Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason, the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights (9:30-10 p.m. EDT)	Not only is Mr. Mason the star of "Chicken Soup," he's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to "Duck Soup	2
Here, in neutral language, is the gist of Mr. Mason's remarks, quoted first in the Village Voice	Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks, so they support black candidates uncritically	3
Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks, so they support black candidates uncritically	He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination, so they, too, support black candidates uncritically	3
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination, so they, too, support black candidates uncritically	He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa	3
Of course, Mr. Mason did not use neutral language	As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt, live television and the nightclub circuit, Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular	3
Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular	He said Jews were "sick with complexes	3
that Mr. Mason is "like a dinosaur	People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck	2
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief	Why constructive	3
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect	Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict	3
Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict	That's why it's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police, on college campuses and elsewhere, taboo all critical mention of group differences	2
Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer	The question is, if group conflicts still exist (as undeniably they do), and if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe, then what other means do we have for letting off steam	2
Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy	It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer	1
It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants	At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie	3
At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie	It couldn't be more obvious that "Chicken Soup" is being made from an old recipe	2
Clearly, the question with "Chicken Soup" is not whether the pot will boil over, but whether it will simmer at all	So far, the bubbles have been few and far between	1
So far, the bubbles have been few and far between	Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms to preach about social issues	3
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms to preach about social issues	To some extent, this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them	3
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker	Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason's comic persona	1
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason's comic persona	The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself	3
I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz	That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have to cool down, not heat up, before it can simmer	2
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America	At your age, Jackie, you ought to know that you can't make soup without turning up the flame	2
The underlying economy remains sound	There is nothing wrong with the economy	3
There is nothing wrong with the economy	all the indices are up	3
Late Friday night, the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened, rather than narrowed, the federal budget deficit	Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases	3
that the administration wouldn't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill	We don't need this as a way to get capital gains	2
Opponents of the cut are playing hardball	Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said he was "confident" that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation wouldn't include a capital-gains tax cut	3
The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress	Because the legislation hasn't been completed, President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law	1
Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill	The House appears reluctant to join the senators	1
The House appears reluctant to join the senators	A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues' decision to drop many pet provisions	3
The Senate bill was stripped of many popular, though revenue-losing, provisions	These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures	3
To the delight of some doctors, the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare	To the detriment of many low-income people, efforts to boost Medicaid funding, especially in rural areas, also were stricken	1
We're looking like idiots	Things had just gone too far	2
that the move required sacrifice by every senator	It worked because there were no exceptions	3
In addition, the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3% excise tax on long-distance telephone calls	It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting	3
Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties	A provision that would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was excised	3
The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell	Mr. Mitchell's relations with Budget Director Darman have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill	2

I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion	The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity	3
The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity	This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable	2

Yes, he did	As I watched him on C-Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings	3
He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution	He used about 56 words defending the witnesses' constitutional rights	3
Unfortunately, by my rough guess, he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth	He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary	3
He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary	As your editorial rightly pointed out, Samuel Pierce, former HUD secretary, and Lance Wilson, Mr. Pierce's former aide, "are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment	2
As your editorial rightly pointed out, Samuel Pierce, former HUD secretary, and Lance Wilson, Mr. Pierce's former aide, "are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment	That certainly is not the supposed "distorted reading" indicated by Mr. Lantos	1
That his "committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD	My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court . . . etc	2
Apparently, their verdict is in	Right now they're pursuing evidence	1
Apparently, their verdict is in.	That's not a bad way to proceed, just somewhat different from standard American practice	3
Of course, Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change	No doubt that's partially true	3
No doubt that's partially true	Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true	2
Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true	He's right about his subcommittee's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior HUD officials	3
But if his explanation of motivation is true, why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity?	No, Mr. Lantos's complaints simply won't wash	3
No, to my mind, the Journal did not "defend sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust	it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense	3
The system is the problem, not an individual member	Individuals can always have their hands slapped	2
Individuals can always have their hands slapped	It's when such slapping doesn't occur that we've got trouble	1
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency (and, yes, maybe criminality) within HUD could possibly generate	The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when "Tail Gunner Joe" McCarthy did his work	3
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person "shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself	This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify	3
Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter	He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution	3
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution	Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution	3
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution	Absent the risk of such prosecution, a court may order the defendant to testify	2
one must conclude that he held a good-faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution	The subcommittee, Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime	2
Thus, when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel, one must conclude that he held a good-faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.	Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination	3
We couldn't get dealers to answer their phones	It was {like} the Friday before Black Monday" two years ago	2
Nonetheless, the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever, diving 14.90, or 3%, to 467.29	Ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading	3
Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors	Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders' inability to handle the volume of calls, rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades	1
It was the last hour of trading on a Friday	There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots	3
There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots	It wasn't intentional, we were all busy	3

When selling is so frenzied, prices fall steeply and fast	Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices	3
some prices fell without trades taking place, as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares	Everyone was hitting everyone else's bid	3

The pace of trading was orderly	Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System "worked beautifully," as did the automated system for larger trades, according to Mr. Hardiman	3
In the past, the OTC market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation	Because Nasdaq's trading volume hasn't returned to pre-crash levels, traders and OTC market officials hope the damage won't be permanent	2

To be sure, big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today	They could still panic and bail out of the market	3
Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for "our favorite stocks that have fallen apart	He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further	3
Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig wasn't daunted when Friday's rout shaved $40 million from the value of the $752 million Janus Fund he oversees	I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through Then he jumped into the market: "I spent $30 million in the last half-hour	3
Other money managers also opened their wallets	I was buying at the close (Friday) and I'll be buying again because I know we're getting good value," said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., Greenwich, Conn	3
I was buying at the close (Friday) and I'll be buying again because I know we're getting good value	There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash	2
big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock	Most often, they do just that	3
The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders, and that they can't react to short-term events, good or bad	Those that pulled out (of stocks) regretted it	3
Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, have been stellar performers this year, rising 27.97% before Friday's plunge, excluding dividends	Even Friday's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20%, well above the annual average for stocks over several decades	2

he discerns many parallels with 1987, including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading	The only thing you don't have "is the `portfolio insurance' phenomenon overlaid on the rest	3
Not really insurance, this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts	In its severest test, the $60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash didn't work, as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected	1
Even without portfolio insurance, market conditions were grim Friday	Neil Weisman said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands	3

Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense, ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV	the Dutch-based international food retailer hadn't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders	2
A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue	He termed ASKO's legal actions as "unproductive" to international cooperation among European retailers	3

And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines	Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through	3
In many ways, the backdrop to Friday's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987's 508-point crash	Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold.	3
Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold	The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy	3
But a similar outcome doesn't seem likely this year	Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday's drop, by itself, isn't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement	2

In that case, there will be plenty of blame to go around	There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut	2
there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds	At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president's policy to include it	3

The White House Office of Management and Budget, whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met, estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $6.2 billion, almost half of the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of $11.0 billion	Rep.

Compaq's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market	One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad, and two others have introduced even smaller "palmtops	3
Compaq's notebooks, by contrast, may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines	Analysts say they're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market	3
Analysts say they're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they're priced aggressively at $2,400 to $5,000	All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases	3
and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly	One analyst, noting that most such machines are about two inches thick, takes exception to the name	2
One analyst, noting that most such machines are about two inches thick, takes exception to the name	This isn't quite a notebook -- I call it a phonebook	3

Instead of a keyboard, it features a writing surface, an electronic pen and the ability to "read" block printing	At 4 1/2 pounds, it may be too ambitiously named, but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth	2
Palmtops aren't far behind	Atari Corp. 's Portfolio weighs less than a pound, costs a mere $400 and runs on three AA batteries, yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs	3
At stake is what Mike Swavely, Compaq's president of North America operations, calls "the Holy Grail of the computer industry" -- the search for "a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere	The market is so new, nobody knows yet how big it can be	1

Despite the sniping, few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that don't make compromises	Toward that end the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba, Zenith and now Compaq	2
Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith's market share	Rod Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive officer, notes pointedly that Zenith's $2,000 MinisPort uses an "unconventional" two-inch floppy disk, whereas Compaq's new machines use the more common 3 1/2-inch disk	3

Tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week	Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino, Calif., company will report revenue of $430 million to $460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share	4
That will spur Tandem's growth	I'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20% next year	3
But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue's machines	The answer isn't price reductions, but new systems	3
Nevertheless, Tandem faces a variety of challenges, the biggest being that customers generally view the company's computers as complementary to IBM's mainframes	Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion, insisting that Tandem's new machines aren't replacements for IBM's mainframes	3

Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals	The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar	3
A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one, mind you -- would be welcomed by the U.S	That wasn't the case in 1987, when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse, producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S	1

Perhaps most prominent, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier, if only by a shade	Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the company still has a big stake in polyethylene	2
At the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8% to 10%	You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better," says James Wilbur, a Smith Barney analyst	3
Still, some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains, largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals	Du Pont Co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments, fibers and polymers	3
