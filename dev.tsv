The bill would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that wouldn't be counted on the federal budget	to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only, unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization	3
But the RTC also requires "working" capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold	That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold	4
It's a problem that clearly has to be resolved	The agency has already spent roughly $19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls, and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes	2
Absent other working capital the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets	We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward	3
That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means, which seems to me sort of draconian	The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility	3
Just days after the 1987 crash, major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors	This time around, they're moving even faster	1
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night	Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday, and wrote another new ad appearing today	3
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night.	Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads	3
It considered running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday	Other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were plotting out potential new ad strategies	3
It considered running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday	Other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were plotting out potential new ad strategies	4
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around	This time, the firms were ready	2
Fidelity, for example, prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge	When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon, the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers	4
A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us	To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial	2
To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial	It would have been too late to think about on Friday	1
It would have been too late to think about on Friday	We had to think about it ahead of time	2
Today's Fidelity ad goes a step further, encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity	Underneath the headline "Diversification," it counsels, "Based on the events of the past week, all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market's volatility." It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name	3
Underneath the headline "Diversification," it counsels, "Based on the events of the past week, all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market's volatility	It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name	4
PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash	In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle, the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house, ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night	3
The new PaineWebber commercial features Mary Farrell, one of the firm's most visible investment strategists, sounding particularly bullish	Taped just as the market closed yesterday, it offers Ms. Farrell advising, "We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle. . . . We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation	3
We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle	We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation	3
We're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything	If you owned it and liked it Friday, the true value hasn't changed	2
If you owned it and liked it Friday, the true value hasn't changed	This isn't 1987 revisited	3
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday, investment firms had to constantly revise their approach	At Shearson Lehman, executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend, then had to regroup yesterday afternoon	3
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday, Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad	We don't think at this point anything needs to be said	2
We don't think at this point anything needs to be said	The market seems to be straightening out	2
The market seems to be straightening out	we're taking a wait-and-see attitude	2
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective	In 1987, despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms, individuals ran from the market en masse	2
In 1987, despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms, individuals ran from the market en masse	Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around	2
Mr. Eskandarian becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold	John Verret, the agency's president and chief executive, will retain the title of president	1
Separately, McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., named Arnold to handle its estimated $4 million cooperative ad account for the Hartford, Conn., area	That account had been handled by Della Femina, McNamee WCRS	4
and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend	The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A's	3
In game two, on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn, a lot of the catching up was done by the A's catcher, Terry Steinbach	He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1, where it stayed	3
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games, and batted in the seventh position of the A's lineup	If you get your pitch, and take a good swing, anything can happen	2
On Saturday night, quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and, no doubt, future droughts	Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17	3
Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17	The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9, a.k.a. the "bottom of the order," got seven of their team's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision	3
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs (29 of 39) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all	That's not an average to soothe Giant rooters	3
but they observe them in relative calm	Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum, and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition, hostilities advanced no further, at least as far as I could see	3
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams	I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday.	3
I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday	I love 'em both	3
I love 'em both	The only thing I'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games	2
although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here, including the A's and Giants, is originally from somewhere else	Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series, or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox (hey, it's possible), you'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans	1
Anyway, the A's gave you a lot of heroes to root for	In the opening game, besides Steinbach and Stewart, there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery	3
there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery	He was flawless afield (ditto in game two), moved a runner along in the A's three-run second inning, and homered for his team's final tally	3
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season, the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph	Not his autograph	1
An A's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson, who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation	He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits, seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats, and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday, along with walking, stealing a base and scoring a run	3
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits, seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats, and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday, along with walking, stealing a base and scoring a run	When you're in the groove, you see every ball tremendously	3
They combined for 25 hits, six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs	They went a collective 5-for-24 here, with zero homers and ribbies	1
It's that last set of numbers, as much as anything else, that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come	I believe in the law of averages	2
I believe in the law of averages	I'd rather see a so-so hitter who's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who's cold	2
But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side	When it goes, you never know when you'll get it back," he said	3
When it goes, you never know when you'll get it back	That's baseball	3

After the 1987 plunge, markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose	The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours	3

It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers	To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility, either all markets should be open to trading or none	1
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday, but they probably would have made for smoother, less volatile executions	It's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open	2
